# Neural net example in Matlab
Theoretical Machine Learning (APPM 7400) class, Spring 2020, at CU Boulder

Run the [neuralNet_demo.m](neuralNet_demo.m) script to start, which includes the SGD. To see the actual neural net backpropagation calculation, look at [evalNN.m](evalNN.m).  The other files are just helper files of less interest
